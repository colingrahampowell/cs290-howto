	<h2>And, We're Off!</h2>

	<p>We'll get to the really cool stuff in a moment. First, however, we need to figure out how to call a typical NASA API, and how to interpret what we get back.</p>

	<p>Now that we have an API key, let’s go ahead and make a call to one of NASA’s APIs. You’ve already seen how the Astronomy Picture of the Day API responds to a call. Let's make a call to the EPIC API and see if we can make sense of the results.</p>

	<h2>Images of Earth</h2>

	<h3>Getting Your Bearings</h3>

	<p>Queries to the EPIC API return either long JSON-formatted lists of images taken by the EPIC instrument on a specific date, or lists of dates on which images were taken (if you're unfamiliar with JSON, you can learn more <a href="http://www.json.org/">here</a>). API endpoints are separated by the color type of the image - "natural" images provide true-color representations of the Earth's surface, which can limit visibility of landmasses. "Enhanced" images are modified to reduce some of the haze and lack of definition caused by Earth's atmosphere, resulting in sharper colors that improve the visibility of Earth's landmasses. This can make for a dramatic difference, as seen here:</p> 

	<div class="img-container">
		<img class="epic-img" src="./images/natural.png">
		<img class="epic-img" src="./images/enhanced.png">
	</div>

	<p>To query the API, we need to make an HTTP request to a specific resource on NASA’s servers - that request will look something like this:</p>

	<pre><code class="language-http">https://api.nasa.gov/EPIC/api/natural/date/2016-04-08?api_key=your_key</code></pre>

	<p>NASA’s server processes the request, and sends back information that you requested. We’ll discuss the particulars of this URL in a minute. First, however, let’s take a look at the EPIC API documentation (found <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#EPIC">here</a>) to see how we might go about doing this.</p>

	<p>We consult the "Querying by Date(s)" table, where we note that there appear to be eight different endpoints - four each for "natural" or "enhanced" image types. These are clearly described by the existing documentation, so we won't review them in detail here. In brief, however, one can query this API for:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Metadata for images taken on to the most recent date.</li>
		<li>Metadata for images taken on a particular date, or</li>
		<li>A listing of all dates with available imagery</li>
	</ul>

	<p>One undocumented "quirk" to keep in mind: it is possible to search for a listing of all dates with available imagery in two ways - through the "available" endpoint as well as the "all" endpoint. Although the documentation treats them identically, each produces a slightly different response. In this guide, we'll use the "available" endpoint; if you use "all", be aware that you may need to modify your program(s) to fit the content that it returns.</p>

	<p>Queries for natural and enhanced color images are identical; if you can learn to find natural-color images, you'll be able to do the same for those with enhanced color. To keep it simple, we'll focus on querying the API for metadata related to natural-color images, as those appear to be more reliably updated.</p>

	<h3>Calling the API</h3>

	<p>Now, we need to put all of this together. NASA APIs generally respond to GET requests (as opposed to POST requests), which means that, to get a response from NASA’s servers, we need to include the necessary parameters as part of the URL that we’re accessing, along with our API Key (don’t forget the API key!). The particulars of GET requests are beyond the scope of this document, but in brief:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The portion of the URL containing our parameters is called the <em>query string</em>, the start of which is denoted by a "?" character.</li>
		<li>Parameters are identified with a <em>key=value</em> syntax, and,</li>
		<li>Parameters are separated by the "&" character.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The EPIC API is somewhat unique in that most of the API's parameters are "built-in" to the address that we use for our API call- to find a list of dates with available enhanced imagery, for instance, we add a "/available" subdirectory to the URL in the base query address. The only parameter that we supply to our query string is the API key. This isn't especially clear from the documentation.</p>

	<p>Let's start by making a request through the browser (we'll tackle Javascript next). To get information back from NASA's EPIC API, we consult the "Querying By Date(s)" table to find the specific resource that we'd like to find. Let's look for the most recent natural-color images. The documentation tells us that, to do this, we call the base URL for the EPIC API (https://api.nasa.gov/EPIC), adding the "/natural" subdirectory to our query along with our API key:</p>

	<pre><code class="language-http">https://api.nasa.gov/EPIC/api/natural?api_key=your_api_key</code></pre>
	
	</p>Navigate to this resource in your browser of choice. You'll see a massive JSON string that looks like a meaningless wall of text. This isn't as scary as it looks. Let's copy the results into a text editor and separate the values a little more carefully to see what we get back.</p>

	<pre><code class="language-json">
[	{"image":"epic_1b_20170226003633_02",
	"caption":"This image was taken by the NASA EPIC camera onboard the NOAA DSCOVR spacecraft",
	"centroid_coordinates":{"lat":-14.931283,"lon":170.062366},

		},"
	},
	{"image":"epic_1b_20170226022436_02",....
	</code></pre>

	<p>Ah, now that's better. With the properties separated like this, we can observe the following:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Results are returned in an array.</li>
		<li>Each array element itself contains an object with <em>image</em>, <em>caption</em>, and <em>centroid_coordinates</em> properties, among others. This object contains all data related to a particular image taken by the EPIC instrument</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Some of these properties are self-explanatory, and some not so much. Let's dive into a few, as these are not discussed in detail in the official API documentation:</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>image</dt>
			<dd>The filename of the image in the NASA EPIC archives (not the file<em>path</em>). The details of accessing specific images can be found in the aforementioned alternate API documentation (located <a href="https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/api">here</a>).</dd>
		<dt>caption</dt>
			<dd>A caption associated with the image, describing that it was taken from the DSCOVR spacecraft. The captions for these images all appear to be the same.</dd>
		<dt>centroid_coordinates</dt>
			<dd>The geographic coordinates at the center of the image, corresponding to a specific point on Earth's surface.</dd>
		<dt>dscovr_j2000_position</dt>
			<dd>The spacecraft's position in space, based on the J2000 (January 1st, 2000) equinox. If you're interested in what, specifically, this means, take a look <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_coordinate_system">here</a>.</dd>
		<dt>lunar_j2000_position</dt>
			<dd>The Moon's position, using the same basis.</dd>
		<dt>sun_j2000_position</dt>
			<dd>The sun's position, using the same basis.</dd>
		<dt>attitude_quarternions</dt>
			<dd>The attitude - or, spatial orientation - of the satellite in space.</dd>
		<dt>date</dt>
			<dd>The date on which the image was taken, accurate to the minute.</dd>
		<dt>coords</dt>
			<dd>Appears to repeat the coordinate-based properties indicated above. It's unclear why this is needed, although it may exist to maintain backwards compatibility.</dd>

	<p>To make sure that we can use the information that we're getting back, let's try to access the image associated with this data. As mentioned above, we have a filename, but no file type or path. Consulting the "Image Locations" table provided with the alternate documentation, we see that this image is accessed by constructing a URL consisting of:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The root URL (either https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/archive OR https://api.nasa.gov/EPIC/archive)</li>
		<li>The "collection", or image color (natural or enhanced)</li>
		<li>The year, month, and date, constructed as "YYYY/MM/DD/"</li>
		<li>The image type (png, jpg, or thumbs)</li>
		<li>The filename, appended with the appropriate image type (png, jpg, or thumbs)</li>
		<li>If accessing the image via api.nasa.gov, an API key (images stored at epic.gsfc.nasa.gov do not appear to require API keys for access)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>So, this is a little complicated, but not insurmountable. Let's try and construct a string for the image above, using the endpoint at api.nasa.gov for consistency.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The root URL is https://api.nasa.gov/EPIC/archive - note the capitalized EPIC, as it is necesssary</li>
		<li>The "collection" is natural</li>
		<li>The year, month, and date, from the "date" parameter returned by the API call, are 2017/02/26</li>
		<li>We'll choose a .jpg file</li>
		<li>The filename is then "epic_1b_20170226003633_02.jpg"</li>
		<li>The API key is the key that we've registered for.</li>
	</ul>

	<p> This gives us a combined URL of:</p>

		<code class="language-http">https://api.nasa.gov/EPIC/archive/natural/2017/02/26/jpg/epic_1b_20170226003633_02.jpg?api_key=your_api_key</code>

	<p>Which, when we navigate to that URL, produces a beautiful image that looks like this:</p>

	<div class="img-container">
		<img class="epic-img" src="https://api.nasa.gov/EPIC/archive/natural/2017/02/26/jpg/epic_1b_20170226003633_02.jpg?api_key=Jmdgeaox1rWq9gAe3Xl7qRVy91iFXWjwodqOGlWT">
	</div>

	<p>Well, there you have it! Images of Earth. But, you don't want to have to manually parse these JSON responses every time you call the API, do you? Fortunately, there's a better way.</p>

	<h2>Doing It With Javascript</h2>

	<h3>Displaying Image URLs in Your Browser's Console</h3>

	<p>Now that we know what sort of data this API returns, let’s expand on the above and use Javascript to make the same type of API call, obtaining the URLs of the most recent images available from the EPIC instrument.</p>

	<p>First, we create an <code class="language-js">XMLHttpRequest</code> object, and give it a name. This object will handle making our GET request. We'll use a series of variables to store the API's root URL as well as the color type that we'd like to search.</p>

	<pre><code class="language-js">		
var key = "your_api_key";

var photoReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
var rootUrl = "https://api.nasa.gov/EPIC/api/";
var imgType = "natural";

photoReq.open("GET", rootUrl + imgType + "?api_key=" + key, true);
	</code></pre>

	<p>We then call the <code class=language-js>open</code> method on that object, passing it the type of request to send ("GET"), the URL of the resource that we're requesting, along with a boolean value indicating whether or not the request is asynchronous (in this case, it is).</p>

	<p>You can read more about the merits of asynchronous requests <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started">here</a>, but in short, making a request <em>synchronously</em> requires your Javascript program to pause and wait for that request to finish before doing anything else, which can make the user's experience with your site frustrating. Sending a request <em>asynchronously</em> allows your program to process and respond to other tasks while waiting for an HTTP request to finish. Asynchronous requests are called "AJAX" (Asynchronous Javascript And HTML) requests, and are very much an accepted, standard way of making HTTP requests.</p>

	<p>Now, before we send our HTTP request to the EPIC API, we need to determine what to do with the response that we've received. Javascript allows us to make <em>event-driven</em> programs, i.e. programs designed to respond to specific events rather than proceed linearly from start to finish. So, we can define what should happen once our GET request loads <em>before</em> we send that request, and give our program a "callback" function that it will execute once the GET request has actually loaded. Until then, the program continues. The <code class="language-js">addEventListener()</code> method of our <code class="language-js">XMLHTTPRequest</code> object accomplishes this for us. Let's take a look:</p>

	<pre><code class="language-js">		
photoReq.addEventListener("load", function loadPhotos() {

	if(photoReq.status >= 200 && photoReq.status < 400) {

		var response = JSON.parse(photoReq.responseText);
		var photoUrl = "https://api.nasa.gov/EPIC/archive/";

		for(var i = 0; i < response.length; i++) {
			var imgSource = response[i].image;
			var date = response[i].date;
			date = date.slice(0, date.indexOf(" ")).split("-");

			console.log(photoUrl + imgType + "/" + date[0] + "/" + date[1] + "/" + date[2] + 
				"/jpg/" + imgSource + ".jpg" + "?api_key=" + key);
		}
	}
	else {
		console.log("Error - something went wrong: " + photoReq.statusText);
	}

});
	</code></pre>

	<p>There's a lot going on here, so we'll take it step-by-step. First, we call the <code class="language-js">addEventListener</code> method on our photoReq object. We pass it the name of the event that we'd like to listen for ("load" indicates that the resource that we've requested has finished loading), along with the function to call once that event is triggered. Within this function, we first check the <code class="language-js">status</code> property of the <code class="language-js">photoReq</code> object, which contains the HTTP status code of the response from NASA's servers. Response codes less than 400 generally indicate success, whereas codes equal to or greater than 400 generally indicate failure.</p>

	 <p>If our request was successful, we first call <code class="language-js">JSON.parse()</code> on the <code class="language-js">responseText</code> property of our <code class="language-js">photoReq</code> object. Remember that a "raw" response from a request will produce a long JSON-formatted response similar to that indicated above. When we use an <code class="language-js">XMLHttpRequest</code> object to make a request, that JSON string is generally stored in the <code class="language-js">responseText</code> property of that object. <code class="language-js">JSON.parse()</code> converts the contents of <code class="language-js">responseText</code> into a Javascript object that we can more easily manipulate and analayze.</p>

	 <p>Recall the structure of the JSON response: an array, with each element in the array an object describing a specific image taken by the EPIC instrument on a particular day. To obtain the URLs of each image that matches those specifications, we can iterate through the <code class="language-js">response</code> array, accessing the <code class="language-js">image</code> property of each object in the array. We then construct a URL to access that image, using the process described above.</p>

	 <p>Note that we need to get a little fancy to separate the "date" parameter into year, month, and day. This line:</p>

	 <pre><code class="language-js">date = date.slice(0, date.indexOf(" ")).split("-");</code></pre>

	 <p>first removes the portion of the date field that contains the specific hour and minute of the photo, then separates the remaining string into array elements by splitting along the "-" character. So, a date string of "2017-02-26 00:31:45" becomes an array with values [2017, 02, 26].</p>

	 <p>Finally, we need to send the request. The following line of code does this for us:</p>

	 <pre><code class="language-js">photoReq.send(null);</code></pre>

	 <p>The <code class="language-js">null</code> argument in the <code class="language-js">send</code> method indicates that the body of the request is empty (as it should be - we're making a GET request).</p> 

	 <p>Make a small HTML file and use the above code in your <code class="language-html">script</code> tag, then open that document with your browser of choice. You'll see the following in your browser's console window:</p>
	 
	 <div class="img-container">
	 	<img id="first-call-img" src="./images/first-call-console.png">
	 </div>

	 <p>Navigate to those URLs (using your own API key, of course), and you should see the same images that you saw when you manually parsed the JSON response. Let's do something slightly more interesting, however, and display those images in the browser.</p>

	 <h3>The Next Step: Displaying the Images Themselves</h3>

	 <p>Go ahead and add some header text to your HTML file that describes the page to potential visitors, along with a "submit" button and a div with an id of "image-container". Maybe something like this:</p>

	<pre><code class="language-html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
	&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
	&lt;script src="./first-call-advanced.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
	&lt;h1&gt;Recent Images from EPIC&lt;/h1&gt;
	&lt;input type="submit" id="get-images" value="Get Images!"&gt;

	&lt;div id="image-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
	</code></pre>

	<p>The styling is up to you, really. Now, let's add a bit more code to our API request script so that, when the button is pressed, images appear.</p>

	<pre><code class="language-javascript">	
var key = "your_api_key";

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", bindSubmit);

function bindSubmit() {

	document.getElementById("get-images").addEventListener("click", function(event) {

		document.getElementById("image-container").textContent = "";

		var photoReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
		var rootUrl = "https://api.nasa.gov/EPIC/api/";
		var imgType = "natural";

		photoReq.open("GET", rootUrl + imgType + "?api_key=" + key, true);
				
		photoReq.addEventListener("load", function loadPhotos() {

			if(photoReq.status >= 200 && photoReq.status < 400) {
				var response = JSON.parse(photoReq.responseText);

				var photoUrl = "https://api.nasa.gov/EPIC/archive/";
				var resultsDisplay = document.getElementById("image-container");
				for(img in response) {	// display images
					var imgSource = response[img].image;

					var date = response[img].date;
					date = date.slice(0, date.indexOf(" ")).split("-");	// results in array of [year,month,day]

					var earthImage = document.createElement("img");
					earthImage.setAttribute("src", photoUrl + imgType + 
						"/" + date[0] + "/" + date[1] + "/" + date[2] + 
						"/jpg/" + imgSource + ".jpg?api_key=" + key);

					resultsDisplay.appendChild(earthImage);
				}
			}
			else {
				console.log("Error - something went wrong: " + photoReq.statusText);
			}
		});

		photoReq.send(null);
		event.preventDefault();
	});	
}
	</code></pre>

	<p>The code above looks a lot more complicated, but the basic elements are the same. There are a couple of key differences:</p> 
	
	<ul>			
		<li>We've added a "click" event listener to our submit button that makes the API call when that event is triggered.</li>
		<li>We've added a "DOMContentLoaded" event listener to the document, which itself binds our "click" event listener to the submit button once all of the page's DOM content has been loaded.</li>
		<li>Whenever the "click" event listener is triggered, the program clears the <code class="language-js">image-container</code> div of any previous searches. This prevents results from piling on top of one another.
		<li>Instead of simply logging our results to the console, we create an <code class=language-html>img</code> element for each photo, placing it in our <code class="language-html">image-container</code> div.</li>
		<li>We call <code class="language-js">preventDefault()</code> on the <code class="language-js">event</code> object, which is passed to our callback function once the "clicked" event triggers.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>That final difference might be especially new to you, but <code class="language-js">preventDefault()</code> just prevents the "submit" button from carrying out its default behavior - in this case, reloading the page. Without it, the browser would immediately refresh the page following <code class="language-js">photoReq.send(null)</code> function, and the images would never display.</p>

	<p>Note the "flow" of the events in the program: first, the page loads. Then, it waits for the submit button to be clicked. Finally, it sends a request to the EPIC API, and processes the results. When we introduce event-driven behavior in our programs, we need to carefully think about the order in which things happen on our page. We'll see this come into play in our project.</p>

	<p>In the meantime, you can check out a live example of this page by clicking the button below. This example adds a little extra styling through CSS to improve the page's appearance. Feel free to use it as inspiration, or add your own styling.</p>

	<h2>What's Next?</h2>
	
	<p>So, you've made a basic call to one of NASA's APIs, and you've managed to do it with Javascript! This should give you a sense of all of the fun things that we can do with these APIs, and with the EPIC API in particular. Now that you've got the basics down, let's tackle a slightly more complicated project.</p>
