	<h2>Project Introduction</h2>

	<p>Now, we're going to sink our teeth into something a little more difficult. Let's try to make use of the detailed information that this API returns for each image, and make a program that, given a set of user-supplied coordinates, finds a photo in the EPIC archives that closely matches those coordinates. This is a deceptively complicated application; as we're limited to 1,000 API requests per hour, we can't simply iterate through every image taken by the EPIC instrument. We'd have to make a separate call for each date on which imagery exists - causing us to run out of our request allotment very quickly. To limit the number of API requests that this program requires per use, we'll have to apply a bit of trigonometry, along with some applied astronomical knowledge. It's going to be fun.</p>

	<h2>But First, Some Math</h2>

	<p>Remember that the DSCOVR spacecraft orbits around the <em>Sun</em>, not the Earth. Its orbit, however, is calibrated such that it is always located directly in-line with the centers of the Earth and Sun. Therefore, each image captured by EPIC approximates the Sun's "view" of Earth at the particular moment in which the image was taken.</p>

	<p>Over the course of a year, as the Earth orbits the Sun, the Earth latitude receiving the most direct rays from the Sun oscillates between roughly -23.44 degrees and 23.44 degrees. At any given moment, the Sun's rays intersect the Earth at a right angle on a particular point between these latitudes. This behavior is due to the Earth's axial tilt, and is the reason that we have seasons. Here's Bill Nye to explain:</p>

	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KUU7IyfR34o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>	
	</iframe>

	<p>Given the nature of DSCOVR's orbit between the Earth and the Sun, we can infer that the centroid coordinates of an EPIC image closely match the point on the Earth's surface receiving the most direct Sun rays at the instant that the image was captured. We know that the latitude of this point varies over the course of a year in a predictable way. So, we have a means to estimate the range of coordinates in a set of images given the time of year in which they were taken.</p>

	<p>The angle of the Sun's rays relative to the Equator is called its <em>declination</em> (read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_of_the_Sun">here</a>). If the Sun's declination is at 12 degrees, for instance, then its rays meet the Earth's surface at a right angle along 12 degrees latitude. The solar declination on a given day can be estimated by:</p>
	
	<img class="formula" src="./images/base-declination-formula.png">
	
	<p>Where N is the day of the year (starting at 0), and d is the declination angle relative to the equator. We can solve for N, which gives us the following formula:</p>	

	<img class="formula" src="./images/derived-declination-formula.png">

	<p>Now we have a way to calculate the day of the year on which the Sun is most focused on a given latitude - and, it follows, the day on which the EPIC instrument is focused along that latitude.</p>

	<p>How does this <em>simplify</em> our program? Well, it allows us to narrow down a potential range of dates for a user-supplied latitude and longitude. If we know that the EPIC instrument is focused on the southern hemisphere between the autumnal and vernal equinoxes, for instance, we can ignore those dates in a search of the northern hemisphere. In this way, we significantly reduce the number of API calls that we need to make, resulting in a more functional, hardy web application.</p>

	<p>Better yet, given our formula above, we can estimate the <em>day</em> that the EPIC instrument is focused on a target latitude, which cuts down the number of requests even more. We can simply grab a small set of image data from the API for dates around the calculated day, allowing for variations in longitude and margin of error in our calculations.</p>

	<p>A final note, however: given that the EPIC satellite orbits the Sun in this way, we're limited to images taken between 23.44 and -23.44 degrees latitude. This means that we won't find an image taken directly above Corvallis (at 44.56 degrees latitude), for instance. We will, however, find the closest match that exists in our data set.</p>

	<h2>The Final Project</h2>

	<p>Now that we have the theory out of the way, let's get to work making an application that puts it to use.</p>

	<h3>Planning Our Approach</h3>

	<p>When you're working with a Javascript program that will make AJAX calls, it's always a good idea to take the time to plan your approach. Think about what needs to happen, and when it needs to happen. In this case, our program must first get a list of available dates with imagery, then filter those dates into a smaller set of candidates for image matches. Finally, it needs to evaluate that subset of images to find the image with centroid coordinates closest to the user's supplied coordinates.</p>

	<p>Let's take another look at the API documentation. We see that we can call the "available" endpoint for a list of all dates with available imagery, given a certain image color (natural or enhanced). That knocks out our first step. Also observe that we can call the "date" endpoint to get a list of images taken on a certain date, also given the image color. This takes care of our second step.</p>

	<p>With this in mind, we know that we'll need to make a <em>series</em> of API calls to get our program working: one to get a list of dates, followed by a number of calls corresponding to the number of "candidate" dates that we've filtered out from that list. It's going to be a little more complicated than a single GET request, but it's nothing that you can't handle. Let's get started.</p>

	<h3>Getting User Input</h3>

	<p>A discussion of the particulars of HTML forms is beyond the scope of this document, but in order to get input from the user, we should create a "skeleton" HTML document that looks something like this:</p>

	<pre><code class="language-html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
	&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
	&lt;title&gt;NASA EPIC API - Find an Image&lt;/title&gt;
	&lt;script src="./nasa_epic.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

	&lt;form id="search-form"&gt;
		&lt;fieldset&gt;
		&lt;legend&gt;Find an Image&lt;/legend&gt;
			&lt;label&gt;Latitude:
				&lt;input type="number" id="lat" value="0"&gt;
			&lt;/label&gt;
			&lt;label&gt;Longitude:
				&lt;input type="number" id="lon" value="0"&gt;
			&lt;/label&gt;
			&lt;input type="submit" value="Search" id="submit-search"&gt;
		&lt;/fieldset&gt;
	&lt;/form&gt;
		&lt;div id="search-results"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
	</code></pre>

	<p>The styling is up to you. Our example below will reference some of these elements by id or value, so be sure that you're comfortable with basic DOM manipulation in Javascript before proceeding.</p>

	<h3>Helper Functions and Useful Constants</h3>

	<p>Now, on to the Javascript.</p>

	<p>When our request / response sequence gets a little more complicated, it's handy to start decomposing specific parts of our program into defined functions. This helps limit the "<a href="http://callbackhell.com/">callback hell</a>" pattern of deeply-indented, inscrutable code.</p>

	<p>So, let's do that. We'll start with some of the constants that we'll use throughout the program, along with a few helper functions:</p>

	<pre><code class="language-js">
var key = "your_key";

var MAX_DEC = 23.44;		// max declination 
var MIN_DEC = -23.44;		// min declination
var DEG_PER_YEAR = 360/365;		
var EARTH_RADIUS_KM = 6371;	// radius of the earth, in km
var DATE_RANGE = 7;		// range of days before/after target that we search
var YEAR = 2016;		// year that we'll use to source our imagery

function declinationToDay(latitude, year) {

	// calculate day number (from 0) where declination = latitude
	var dayNum = toDeg(Math.acos( (latitude / MIN_DEC) )) / DEG_PER_YEAR - 10;

	var dateOf = new Date(year, 0);
	dateOf.setDate(dayNum);	
	dateOf.setHours(0);

	return dateOf;
}

function toDeg(rad) {  return ((rad) * 360) / (2 * Math.PI); }
function toRad(deg) { return (deg * Math.PI / 180); }

function clearResults() {
	document.getElementById("search-results").textContent = "";
}

function displayWaitMessage() {
	var searchnote = document.createElement("h2");
	searchnote.textContent = "Just A Moment...";
	document.getElementById("search-results").appendChild(searchnote);
}
	</code></pre>	

	<p>We set <code class="language-js">YEAR</code> as a global constant to ensure that, program-wide, we source our imagery from the year 2016. This helps to simplify some of the date calculations in our program, and ensures that we're sourcing from a year with complete image data (as the DSCOVR craft was launched in 2015).</p>

	<p>The <code class="language-js">declinationToDay</code> function puts into Javascript the final formula described above- it allows us to enter a specific latitude between 23.44 and -23.44, and returns a Date object corresponding to the day on which the Sun's declination matched that latitude.</p>

	<p>The <code class="language-js">toDeg</code> and <code class="language-js">toRad</code> functions simply return their argument converted to degrees or radians.</p>

	<p>The <code class="language-js">clearResults</code> and <code class="language-js">displayWaitMessage</code> functions exist to avoid repetition in our code.</p>

	<h3>Getting A List of Dates</h3>

	<p>We now set up our first API call:</p>

	<pre><code class="language-js">
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", bindSubmit);

function bindSubmit() {
	document.getElementById("submit-search").addEventListener("click", function(event) {

		clearResults();
		displayWaitMessage();

		var dateReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
		var rootUrl = "https://api.nasa.gov/EPIC/api/";

		// make string for image type
		var imgType = "natural";

		var lat = document.getElementById("lat").value;
		var lon = document.getElementById("lon").value;

		// obtain available imagery dates 
		dateReq.open("GET", rootUrl + imgType + "/available?api_key=" + key, true);
	</code></pre>

	<p>This code segment starts with the familiar "DOMContentLoaded" event listener that calls a <code class="language-js">bindSubmit</code> function when it triggers. Below that,<code class="language-js">bindSubmit</code> adds a "click" event listener on our "Submit" button.</p>

	<p>When the "click" event triggers, our program clears any existing results, gets data from its document's HTML form (via <code class="language-js">clearResults</code>), and adds a "Just a Moment" note instructing the user that the search is in progress (via <code class="language-js">displayWaitMessage</code>). This isn't absolutely necessary, but the search process can take a few seconds, so it's good practice to alert the user that something is actually happening when they click the "Submit" button.</p>

	<p>Note that, again, we limit our search to natural-color images to keep things straightforward and dependable. If you'd like to search with enhanced-color images, just change the value of imgType. We'll write our program such that it will be simple for you to come back later and change this property, or even allow the user to select the color type that they would like to search.</p>

	<p>Next, we open a GET request to the API's "available" endpoint, which will give us the list of dates with available imagery. This command accesses a different part of the API, but the ideas are identical to the example on the previous page - we build a URL matching the resource that we'd like to access, then pass that as an argument to the <code class="language-js">open</code> method. Don't forget to add the <code class="language-js">true</code> argument, which indicates that this is an asynchronous request.</p>

	<p>On with the next section:</p>

	<pre><code class="language-js">
		dateReq.addEventListener("load", function() {
			if(dateReq.status >= 200 && dateReq.status < 400) {
				var response = JSON.parse(dateReq.responseText);
				response = filterUnique(response);
				var	targetDay;
				// filter by solar declination angle (angle of sun above/below equator)
				if (lat > MAX_DEC) {
					targetDay = declinationToDay(MAX_DEC, YEAR);	//select dates around summer solstice
				}
				else if (lat < MIN_DEC) {
					targetDay = declinationToDay(MIN_DEC, YEAR);	//select dates around winter solstice
				}
				else {
					targetDay = declinationToDay(lat, YEAR);		// calculate day at that declination
				}

				// filter dates such that only those one week prior and one week after target date are included
				response = filterDates(response, targetDay);
				// proceed to next step - get image data for each candidate date
				getImageData(response, imgType, lat, lon);
			}
			else {
				console.log("Error in request: " + dateReq.status);
			}
		});
	</code></pre>

	<p>Now we're getting into the meat of our program. As with the previous example, we parse the JSON data returned by our API call, which gives us an array of date strings in YYYY-MM-DD format. In my experience working with this API, there were occasionally instances of duplicate dates in the returned list, so we call the filterUnique function to filter out any of these duplicate values:</p>

	<pre><code class="language-js">
function filterUnique(dates) {

	var filteredArray = [];

	for(day in dates) {
		if(filteredArray.indexOf(dates[day]) === -1) {
			filteredArray.push(dates[day]);
		} 
	}

	return filteredArray;
}
	</code></pre>

	<p>Whether these duplicate values were the result of a server glitch or simply a "quirk" of the API is uncertain.</p>

	<p>Returning to our "load" event listener, we need to find the date on which the DSCOVR spacecraft (and its EPIC instrument) is focused nearest to our target latitude. Notice that any latitudes above 23.44 are "corrected" to the maximum possible latitude of 23.44. Recall our discussion above, where we note that the declination of the Sun never exceeds 23.44. If the target latitude is above this number, the best we can do is select dates around the summer solstice. The opposite is true for latitudes below -23.44: our best bet is to select dates around the winter solstice. For latitudes between -23.44 and 23.44, we can pass the entered latitude directly to our <code class="language-js">declinationToDay</code> function.</p>

	<p>At this point, we have a target date to search around, so we need to again filter our <code class="language-js">response</code> array such that it only includes days within the range that we've specified as a constant: 7 days before and after the target day.</p>

	<pre><code class="language-js">
function filterDates(dates, targetDay, dateRange) {

	var filteredArray = [];

	var min = new Date(targetDay);
	min.setDate( min.getDate() - dateRange );

	var max = new Date(targetDay);
	max.setDate( max.getDate() + dateRange );

	for(day in dates) {

		var dayArray = dates[day].split("-");	// returns array with [year, month, day]
		// Months are zero-indexed
		var candidate = new Date(dayArray[0], dayArray[1] - 1, dayArray[2]);

		console.log("day1a: " + dates[day] + " day1b: " + candidate.toString());

		if( (candidate.getTime() >= min.getTime()) 
			&& candidate.getTime() <= max.getTime()) {
			filteredArray.push(dates[day]);
		}
	}

	return filteredArray;
}
	</code></pre>

	<p>We have to get a little fancy with Date objects to keep this function brief. We create Date objects corresponding to <code class="language-js">dateRange</code> days before and <code class="language-js">dateRange</code> days after our target date. Then for each day in the <code class="language-js">dates</code> array, we create a new Date object corresponding to that day. We employ a similar process to that shown on the previous page: splitting the string at <code class="language-js">dates[day]</code> into an array containing values corresponding to year, month, and day.</p>

	<p>Now, we compare this Date object to the <code class="language-js">min</code> and <code class="language-js">max</code> Date objects. If <code class="language-js">candidate</code> is within this range, the corresponding day in the <code class="language-js">dates</code> array is pushed to our filtered array. <code class="language-js">filteredArray</code> is returned after we've iterated through each element in <code class="language-js">dates</code>.</p>

	<p>It's important to note that we may end up sourcing data from the years 2015 and 2017 if our <code class="language-js">targetDay</code> is very early or very late in a calendar year. This is not an issue as there is reliable, consistent image data in both December 2015 and January 2017 - hence, our reason for choosing 2016. If you see these years when debugging, however, know that you haven't gone crazy.</p>

	<p>After filtering our dates down to the range that we've specified, we call a function called <code class="language-js">getImageData</code> to, as you might guess, obtain image data for the dates that we've specified. First, however, let's finish our "click" event listener and its enclosing bindSubmit function by sending <code class="language-js">dateReq</code> and calling <code class="language-js">preventDefault</code> to stop the "Submit" button from reloading our page.</p>
	
	<pre><code class="language-js">
	dateReq.send();
	event.preventDefault();

	});	// close click event listener

}	// close bindSubmit
	</code></pre>


	<h3>Processing Image Data</h3>

	<p>We now move to the portion of the program in which we process image data for each of the dates in our filtered array. To accomplish this, we call <code class="language-js">getImageData</code>, which is written like so:</p>

	<pre><code class="language-js">
function getImageData(dates, imgType, lat, lon) {

	var imageData = [];
	var completed = 0;
	var rootUrl = "https://api.nasa.gov/EPIC/api/";

	for(var i = 0; i < dates.length; i++) {
		(function (i) {			// create different closure for each date
			var imgReq = new XMLHttpRequest();

			imgReq.open("GET", rootUrl + imgType + "/date/" 
				+ dates[i] + "?api_key=" + key, true);

			imgReq.addEventListener("load", function() {			
				if(imgReq.status >= 200 && imgReq.status < 400) {		
					var response = JSON.parse(imgReq.responseText);
					// "flatten" response into 1-D array
					for(var j = 0; j < response.length; j++) {
						imageData.push(response[j]);
					}
				}
				else {
					console.log("Error fetching data for " + dates[i].date
						+ ": " + imgReq.statusText);
				}

				completed++;	
				// callback once we're finished
				if(completed == dates.length) {
					if(imageData.length > 0) {
						findClosest(imageData, imgType, lat, lon);
					}
					else {	// no images to display.
						clearResults();
					}
				}
			});

			imgReq.send(null);
	
		})(i);
	}
}
	</code></pre>

	<p>Again, lots of different things happening here, but we'll walk through it together.</p>

	<p>First, it's important to note that we're requesting values from another set of endpoints in the EPIC API - image data associated to a particular date. The syntax for this is very similar to the GET requests you've seen in the past. The API responds to these requests very similarly to a request for the most recent image data - with an array of objects, each having properties describing a particular image.</p>

	<p>To obtain image data for each date in the <code class="language-js">dates</code> array, we need loop through each element in that array, making a GET request for the image data corresponding to the date string contained in that element. To accomplish this, we'll need to wrap our GET request in an immediately-called function, creating a separate closure for each iteration of the loop. If we didn't have this function, the function called when <code class="language-js">imgReq</code>'s "load" event handler fires would likely fail, or at least generate unexpected results. Why is this? Well, recall that in Javascript a variable can be envisioned as a tentacle reaching out to a specific value. When we reassign imgReq on each iteration through the loop, we update which value the tentacle reaches. Recall, too, that our program is <em>event-driven</em> - this means that the "load" event will likely trigger once our program has moved out of this loop and into subsequent commands. So, assuming that this is the case, we see that when, eventually, an <code class="language-js">imgReq</code> object's "load" event triggers, there is a mismatch between the object associated with that trigger and the <code class="language-js">imgReq</code> object referenced inside of the triggered function. Essentially, the "correct" <code class="language-js">imgReq</code> object has been overwritten.</p>

	<p>Fortunately, by creating a closure we can "freeze" the value of <code class="language-js">imgReq</code> every time the enclosing function is called. We can then ensure that it isn't overwritten by subsequent iterations through our for loop.</p>

	<p>Moving on: once each GET request completes, we add the content of the response to our <code class="language-js">imageData</code> array. Recall that the response is itself wrapped in an array - to avoid over-complicating the processing that we'll undertake later, we push each object in the response into <code class="language-js">imageData</code> separately, which allows <code class="language-js">imageData</code> to remain as a 1-D array rather than an array of arrays.</p>

	<p>Finally, note the <code class="language-js">completed</code> variable. Because we're making requests asynchronously, we need to track how many requests have completed so that we know when to start processing our image data. By declaring a variable outside of the for loop's scope, we ensure that each of the callback functions attached to <code class="language-js">imgReq</code> objects has access to the same <code class="language-js">completed</code>variable. After each successful "load" event (successful or not), the value of <code class="language-js">completed</code> is incremented. Once its value equals the length of the list of dates, the function knows to call <code class="language-js">findClosest</code> - assuming that at least one of the requests was successful.</p>

	<p>Phew. We're finally finished with our API calls. On to that <code class="language-js">findClosest</code> function...</p>

	 <pre><code class="language-js">
function findClosest(imageData, imgType, targetLat, targetLon) {

	var closest = imageData[0];
	var coords = imageData[0].centroid_coordinates;

	var closestDistance = haversineDistance(targetLat, targetLon, coords.lat, coords.lon);

	for(var image = 1; image < imageData.length; image++) {

		coords = imageData[image].centroid_coordinates;
		var testDistance = haversineDistance(targetLat, targetLon, coords.lat, coords.lon);

		if(testDistance < closestDistance) {
			closest = imageData[image];
			closestDistance = testDistance;
		}
	}

	displayImage(closest, imgType);
}
	</code></pre>

	<p>This function just performs a linear search for the image with centroid coordinates closest to our target latitude and longitude. To do so, we need to calculate the distance between those coordinates and the centroid coordinates in each image.</p>

	<p>Note that, to do so, we call the <code class="language-js">haversineDistance</code> function. Let's go ahead and introduce it to you:</p>

	<pre><code class="language-js">
function haversineDistance(targetLat, targetLon, testLat, testLon) {

	var lat1 = toRad(targetLat);
	var lat2 = toRad(testLat);
	delta_lat = toRad(targetLat - testLat);
	delta_lon = toRad(targetLon - testLon);

	var lon1 = toRad(targetLon);
	var lon2 = toRad(testLon);

	var hav_lat = Math.sin(delta_lat / 2) * Math.sin(delta_lat / 2);
	var hav_lon = Math.sin(delta_lon / 2) * Math.sin(delta_lon / 2);
	var a = hav_lat + Math.cos(lat1) * Math.cos(lat2) * hav_lon;
	
	return 2 * EARTH_RADIUS_KM * Math.asin( Math.sqrt(a) );
}
	</code></pre>	

	<p><code class="language-js">haversineDistance</code> uses the Haversine Formula to calculate the "great circle" - or, straight-line - distance between two coordinates on the Earth's surface. You can read about it in detail <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula">here</a>.</p>

	<h3>Displaying the Image</h3>

	<p>Returning to our <code class="language-js">findClosest</code> function, we note that once the image with centroid coordinates closest to our target has been identified, our function calls <code class="language-js">displayImage</code>:</p>

	<pre><code class="language-js">
function displayImage(imageData, imgType) {

	clearResults();
	var results = document.getElementById("search-results");

	var imgLocation = imageData.image;
	var imgRoot = "https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/archive/";

	// parse to find year, month, day 
	var date = imageData.date;
	date = date.slice(0, date.indexOf(" ")).split("-");

	var img = document.createElement("img");

	img.setAttribute("src", imgRoot + imgType + "/" + date[0] + "/" + date[1] + "/" + date[2] + 
		"/png/" + imgLocation + ".png");

	var resultsHeader = document.createElement("h2");
	resultsHeader.textContent = "Your Result:";

	results.appendChild(resultsHeader);
	results.appendChild(img);
}
	</code></pre>	

	<p>This should look familiar to you. Note that, in this case, we're accessing the "alternate" image source URLs at epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/archive/, as these don't require API keys. We're going to display the image on our site, so we don't want its <code class="language-html">src</code> attribute to display our API key to anyone browsing through the DOM.</p>	

 	<p>The rest of this is straightforward - we get our image's URL, create an <code class="language-html">img</code> element and set its <code class="language-html">src</code> attribute to that URL, and voila! A image of earth, centered near the coordinates of your choosing.</p>

 	<h3>Testing it Out</h3>

 	<p>Now, let's put all of this together and try to find some interesting results.</p>

 	<p>Hmm...how about Corvallis, OR (44.5646°, -123.2620°)?</p>

			<img class="epic-img" src="./images/corvallis.png">
 	
	<p>That's what we expected! An image taken near latitude 23.44, at a longitude near that of Corvallis. You can see the west coast through the haze. How about something closer to the Equator - Mumbai, India, perhaps (19.0760°, 72.8777°)?</p>

		<img class="epic-img" src="./images/mumbai.png">

	<p>Yep, that's Mumbai. Now, what about Alice Springs, Australia (-23.6980°, 133.8807°)?</p>

		<img class="epic-img" src="./images/alice-springs.png">

	<p>Still spot-on. Finally, let's try Lima, Peru (-12.0464°, -77.0428°):</p>
